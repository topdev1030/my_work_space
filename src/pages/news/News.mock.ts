Data breaches result in financial and reputational damage but also lead to legal consequences. Therefore, robust data access security measures are essential to safeguard an organization\'s assets, maintain customer trust, and meet regulatory requirements. </p>\n<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://satoricyber.com/data-security-platform/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><b>Data Security Platform</b></a> is essential for full visibility and control of sensitive data. One example is Satori\'s Universal Data Permissions Scanner (UDPS), an open-source authorization analysis tool.<b> <a href="https://github.com/SatoriCyber/universal-data-permissions-scanner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UDPS</a></b>, available on GitHub, enables universal visibility into data access permissions across various data stores. With this tool, it\'s easier to identify who has the potential to access sensitive data, which can help organizations take a proactive approach to enhancing their security posture, streamline compliance, and ensure well-governed data access.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Need for Universal Data Permissions</h2>\n<p>In managing data access permissions across large volumes of data, data engineers have to deal with several challenges.</p>\n<p>One such challenge is the complexity of granting and revoking permissions to various users across many data repositories. As organizations scale up their operations and data grows exponentially, keeping track of who has access to what becomes increasingly challenging. </p>\n<p>This complexity can lead to errors, security vulnerabilities, and difficulties in maintaining an audit trail of data access, which is crucial for compliance and security purposes. Data engineers are often tasked with maintaining a fine balance between providing access to authorized users and safeguarding data from unauthorized access.</p>\n<h3>Dispersed Data Stores</h3>\n<p>The data access permissions management landscape has become more complicated in recent years due to the widespread adoption of cloud computing. Data engineers face a highly distributed data landscape, with data now residing in on-prem data centers, multiple cloud platforms, and edge devices. Ensuring data security and governance across these diverse environments requires a more unified approach to data access permissions. </p>\n<p>The dynamic nature of the cloud means that traditional access control models may no longer suffice, and data engineers must adopt new paradigms that include granular control, visibility, and governance. </p>\n<h2>Satori\'s UDPS</h2>\n<p>Satori\'s <a href="https://satoricyber.com/universal-data-permissions-scanner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><b>open-source UDPS</b></a> takes a proactive and comprehensive approach to data access authorization. It scans and analyzes the permissions model of each data platform to retrieve a human-readable list of users and their access level to data assets, including database tables, cloud storage buckets, files, and more.</p>\n<p>Instead of requiring data engineers to navigate the intricacies of each individual data store\'s access controls, UDPS provides a unified platform to view and manage data permissions across all data repositories. Data engineers no longer need to use different access control mechanisms, reducing the potential for errors and unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>The standout feature of UDPS is its universal visibility into data access permissions. After scanning all databases, data warehouses, cloud accounts, and data lakes, UDPS analyzes the permissions and retrieves a list of users, their access levels, and what they have access to. </p>\n<p>The Universal Data Permissions Scanner is available in two ways: </p>\n\n<ol><li>Scan the permissions structure of a database to get the list of all users and data assets they can access. </li><li>Posture Manager - a fully managed SaaS solution to periodically scan, store, and visualize all users and data assets they can access. </li></ol><p></p>\n\n<p>Data engineers gain greater visibility, allowing them to quickly identify overprivileged users, unauthorized access, or unusual behavior in real time. Universal visibility simplifies the auditing process and ensures that data access remains transparent and compliant with security and privacy regulations.</p>\n<p>Data engineers can efficiently manage data security and governance, reducing secure and compliant data access challenges.</p>\n<h2>Benefits of Using an OS UDPS</h2>\n<ol><li><strong>Identifying Overprivileged Users and Reducing Security Risks:</strong> With comprehensive visibility into data access permissions, organizations can pinpoint individuals or accounts granted unnecessary or excessive access to sensitive data. By identifying and rectifying overprivileged users, businesses can reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data access.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlining Compliance Reporting and Privacy Law Compliance: </strong>Organizations generate compliance reports more efficiently by aggregating data access information across various repositories. This streamlines the reporting process and ensures data access aligns with regulatory requirements.

			'<div><body><div><div id="body">\n<p>Singapore-based infosec outfit Group-IB on Thursday released details of a new Android trojan that exploits the operating system\'s accessibility features to steal info that enables theft of personal information.</p>\n<p>The security research outfit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.group-ib.com/blog/golddigger-fraud-matrix/">wrote</a> that the trojan, named GoldDigger, currently targets Vietnamese banking apps – but includes code suggesting its developers plan wider attacks. Between June 2023, when it spotted GoldDigger, and late August, Group-IB <a target="_blank" href="https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/golddigger-trojan-vietnam/">identified</a> 51 financial organization applications targeted by the trojan. The security form is unsure how many devices have been infected, or how much money has been stolen.</p>\n<p>The malware makes its way onto devices after users visit fake websites that manipulate them into downloading the app. Once installed, GoldDigger requests access to Android’s Accessibility Service – the feature designed to assist users with disabilities by allowing apps to interact with each other and modify the user interface.</p>\n\n    \n\n<p>Permission to use the Accessibility Service means GoldDigger can monitor and manipulate a device\'s functions and view personal information such as banking app credentials and the content of SMS messages, and send that info to command-and-control servers. A code snippet found by the researchers suggests the malware attempts to bypass two factor authentication, and is designed to fool banking apps that it is making legitimate transactions.</p>\n\n<p>"We have not confirmed that the Trojan operators use these capabilities at the time of writing. However, based on the behavior of other known Trojans similar to GoldDigger, we don\'t think they differ significantly," explained Group-IB.</p>\n<p>"We are definitely observing a significant increase in the Android malware strains abusing the Accessibility Service. For Android malware trends, there is a noticeable shift away from the traditional use of web fakes," Sharmine Low, malware analyst at Group-IB, told <i>The Register</i>. Low said using the Accessibility Function was a "much more invasive approach compared to generating individual web fake files for each specific target."</p>\n\n        \n\n<p>GoldDigger\'s developers have left clues that their ambitions may reach beyond Vietnam. The malware includes translations in Chinese and Spanish, suggesting that countries where those languages are spoken may be next in line as targets.</p>\n<p>One way the security firm noted the malware could be prevented – aside from the usual check for updates, watch out for unusual permissions and adopting fraud protection services – is to keep the "Install from Unknown Sources" setting disabled by default on Android devices. Only if the setting is enabled can APKs from sources outside Google Play Store be installed. ®</p>                                \n<p> </p>\n\n                    </div>\n\n\n\n                            </div></body></div>',

The two research teams have already discovered multiple actively exploited zero-days in Apple products that were exploited in targeted attacks against high-profile individuals, such as opposition politicians, dissidents, and journalists.</p> <p>The Russian zero-day broker firm Operation Zero, <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/151607/hacking/russian-zero-day-broker-offering.html">recently increased payouts</a> for top-tier mobile exploits. The company is willing to pay up to $20,000,000 for zero-day exploits for iPhone and Android devices.</p> <p>The Russian company pointed out that the end user for its exploits is a non-NATO country, it also added that decided to increase the payout due to high demand on the market.</p> <p>Unlike other zero-day brokers, such as <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/?s=Zerodium">Zerodium</a> and <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/50173/breaking-news/zero-day-bug-bounty-program.html">Exodus Intelligence</a>, Operation Zero focuses on the Russian market.

"Ensuring software is secure by design will help keep every organization and every American more secure."</body></div>',

During my daily sweep of all the ransomware shame sites, I came across Lorenz\'s broken contact form. It was really as simple as viewing the source on the page and copy-pasting the leaked file path. It was pretty much placed in my lap, I didn\'t even need to do a vulnerability scan."</p>\n<p>According to htmalgae, Lorenz closed access to its online contact form, preventing contact attempts using it, but the root issue "has not been addressed."</p>\n\n        \n\n<p>At the time of writing, Lorenz\'s website and online contact form are still accessible, and users can submit requests, but they are not actually being sent to the group at this time.</p>\n<div><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/10/04/lorenz_leak_contact_form_screenshot.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/10/04/lorenz_leak_contact_form_screenshot.jpg?x=648&amp;y=324&amp;infer_y=1" alt="Screenshot of the Lorenz ransomware groups\' online contact portal" title="Screenshot of the Lorenz ransomware groups\' online contact portal"></a>\n<p>Screenshot of the Lorenz ransomware groups\' online contact portal</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Lorenz discovery marks a rare occurrence of a ransomware group leaking data against their schedule.</p>\n<p>Publishing data belonging to victims they have failed to extort is a common practice of ransomware criminals, but many of those involved in the latest leak weren\'t victims of ransomware encryption.</p>\n<p>Most had their identities masked behind fake names and obscure Proton Mail email addresses &#8211; a platform favored by many dark web users &#8211; but some included details that identified them personally. These included reporters, those working in financial services, and security researchers, among others.</p>\n\n<h3>What is the Lorenz ransomware group?</h3>\n<p>First observed in early 2021, the Lorenz ransomware is believed by experts to be a rebrand of the .sZ40 strain discovered in October 2020, which in turn is linked with the ThunderCrypt strain of 2017. The group\'s victim blog also shows \'.sZ40\' written across its homepage banner.</p>\n<p>Like many leading ransomware operations, Lorenz is known for using a double-extortion model in attacks whereby they steal data before encrypting victims\' devices, holding both their data and systems to ransom.</p>\n<p>This approach is designed to mitigate the possibility of victims simply restoring from backups and not having to pay the ransom demands for unlocking access to devices.</p>\n\n        \n\n<p>One of its most notorious attacks took place last year when it was observed <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/13/lorenz_ransomware_mitel_voip/">exploiting a vulnerability in Mitel\'s VoIP systems</a>, tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29499" rel="nofollow">CVE-2022-29499</a>, to break into organizations and encrypt their data using Microsoft\'s BitLocker Drive Encryption.</p>\n<p>Cybereason categorizes the group\'s threat level as "high" due to the destructive nature of their attacks. Lorenz is also thought to be a sophisticated operation, with the individuals involved typically investing "a lot of effort into their attacks," including custom binaries for nearly every attack.</p>\n<p>"They study their target\'s employees, suppliers, and partners. This way, the Lorenz group can even go from one, already compromised victim to another. The knowledge they have collected is used to customize the attack specifically for the target," Cybereason said.</p>\n<p>In addition to double-extortion activities, Lorenz is also known for acting as an initial access broker (IABs), selling the access it secures to corporate networks to other cybercriminals who can then launch additional attacks.</p>\n<p>SentinelOne <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/lorenz/" rel="nofollow">said</a> Lorenz relied on IABs in the past to launch its own attacks, as well as acting as one itself.</p>\n<p>Lorenz isn\'t among the most prolific ransomware groups in operation, failing to appear in any of the top rankings for 2023.</p>\n<p>It only posted 16 victims to its leak site in 2023, including those whose identities were kept anonymous due to the ransom being paid. By contrast, AlphV/BlackCat posted 13 victims in just the past seven days. &#174;</p>                                \n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n                    </div>\n\n\n\n                            </div></div></body></html>',

Sony notified about 6,800 individuals, it confirmed that the security breach was the result of the exploitation of the zero-day vulnerability <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/146998/security/cisa-moveit-transfer-0day-catalog.html">CVE-2023-34362</a> in the <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/147093/hacking/clop-ransomware-moveit-transfer.html">MOVEit Transfer platform</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/142130/cyber-crime/clop-ransomware-goanywhere-mft.html">Clop ransomware</a> gang (aka <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/145952/apt/iranian-apt-papercut-exploitation.html">Lace Tempest</a>) is <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/147093/hacking/clop-ransomware-moveit-transfer.html"><strong>credited</strong></a> by Microsoft for the recent campaign that exploits a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/146998/security/cisa-moveit-transfer-0day-catalog.html">CVE-2023-34362</a>, in the <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/146963/hacking/moveit-transfer-zero-day.html">MOVEit Transfer</a> platform.</p> <p>MOVEit Transfer is a managed file transfer that is used by enterprises to securely transfer files using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads.</p> <p>The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability, it an be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer’s database.</p> <p><em>“a SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an un-authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer’s database.” reads the <a href="https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023"><strong>advisory</strong></a> published by the company. “Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or delete database elements.”</em></p> <p>The vulnerability affects all MOVEit Transfer versions, it doesn’t affect the cloud version of the product. The company also shared Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for this attack and urges customers who notice any of the indicators to immediately <a href="https://community.progress.com/s/supportlink-landing">contact</a> its security and IT teams.</p> <p>In late June, the <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/147195/cyber-crime/clop-ransomware-moveit-transfer-attacks.html">Clop ransomware</a> gang added Sony to its list of victims on its leak site. </p> <p>“We are writing to you as we believe you are a former employee of Sony Interactive Entertainment (“SIE”) or are a family member of a current or former employee of SIE.” reads the <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/8b595be6-d1d7-47df-84d5-05738edd84f9.shtml">data breach notification</a> sent to the impacted individuals.</p> <p>“On May 31, 2023, Progress Software announced a newly discovered vulnerability in its MOVEit file transfer platform, which is used by SIE and thousands of other enterprises around the world. On May 28, 2023, before Progress Software announced the vulnerability and we became aware of it, an unauthorized actor used the vulnerability to download some SIE files stored on our MOVEit platform. On June 2, 2023, SIE discovered the unauthorized downloads, immediately took the platform offline and remediated the vulnerability. An investigation was then launched with assistance from external cybersecurity experts.” </p> <p>Once it had discovered the unauthorized downloads, SIE launched an investigation into the security breach and notified law enforcement. </p> <p>In response to the incident, SIE has increased the monitoring of its systems. The company pointed out that they are not aware of the publication or misuse of the stolen personal information. The company is also offering complimentary Equifax Complete Premier credit monitoring and identity restoration services to the impacted individuals. </p> <p>In September, Sony <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/151518/data-breach/threat-actors-claim-sony-hack.html">announced</a> it was investigating allegations of a data breach after the RansomedVC extortion group claimed to have hacked the company and added the company to its Tor leak site.</p> <p><em>“We are currently investigating the situation, and we have no further comment at this time.” Sony said.</em></p> <p>The ransomware group published some files as proof of the hack, but it is unclear if the threat actors were able to compromise all the company’s systems.</p> <p>RansomedVC <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sony-investigates-cyberattack-as-hackers-fight-over-whos-responsible/"><strong>told</strong></a> BleepingComputer that it has stolen 260 GB of data from Sony’s networks and they are attempting to sell stolen data for $2.5 million.</p> <p>While RansomedVC claims the hack, another threat actor that goes online with the moniker ‘MajorNelson’ also claims responsibility for the attack and says RansomVC is lying.</p> <p>MajorNelson leaked a compressed archive of 2.4 GB in size which contains “A lot of credentials for internal systems,” and data related to</p> <ul> <li>SonarQube</li> <li>Creators Cloud</li> <li>Sony’s certificates</li> <li>A device emulator for generating licenses</li> <li>qasop security</li> <li>Incident response policies</li> <li>and more.</li> </ul> <p>At the time of this writing we cannot exclude that Sony has suffered more than a data breach since June.</p> <p>Follow me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/securityaffairs"><strong>@securityaffairs</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sec.affairs"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@securityaffairs"><strong>Mastodon</strong></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pierluigi-paganini/b/742/559"><strong>Pierluigi Paganini</strong></a></p> <p><strong>(</strong><a href="http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/"><strong>SecurityAffairs</strong></a><strong> –</strong> <strong>hacking, Clop ransomware)</strong></p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://securityaffairs.com/151982/data-breach/sony-sent-data-breach-notifications-to-about-6800-individuals.html">Sony sent data breach notifications to about 6,800 individuals</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://securityaffairs.com">Security Affairs</a>.</p>',

They also cast a wide net in terms of the info they collect, with the capability to steal data from the target system, various applications and browsers, and even the users themselves.Further, the campaign has what appears to be a lucrative monetization aspect: It targets cryptocurrency users by modifying crypto addresses to redirect transactions to the attacker, according to Checkmarx. In fact, one of the crypto wallet addresses accepting these transactions showed a six-figure amount during the time period that the malicious packages were active."The sheer volume and persistence of these deployments hinted at an attacker with a well-crafted agenda," Checkmarx security researcher Yehuda Gelb wrote in the post.Moreover, the attacker has shown a steady evolution in the sophistication of the packages, transitioning from plaintext to encryption to multilayered obfuscation — even secondary disassembly payloads."The threat actors\' most recent packages adeptly dismantle system defenses, leaving it exposed and vulnerable," Gelb wrote.Multiphase EvolutionThe attacker employed a multiphase attack sequence, reflected in the activity of the malicious packages as they evolved since they initially appeared in early April.In the beginning, the packages, written in plaintext, "were deceptively transparent," according to Gelb. They "would subtly integrate themselves into unsuspecting systems, all the while laying the groundwork for their malicious endeavors," he wrote.Those activities began with a stealthy installation of dependencies and a subprocess that prevented any console window from surfacing to alert users, followed by an ability to sense the environment to cease activity at signs of detection.Once this initial activity ended, the packages would set about their real task of collecting data from an infected system, extracting sensitive data including usernames, passwords, history, cookies, and payment information from Opera, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Yandex browsers. They also mined data from various apps, including Atomic, Exodus, Steam, and NationsGlory, packaging the data into ZIP files before extracting them.Other capabilities of the packages during this initial phase included a search of the user\'s directories for potentially valuable files and subsequent upload of finds to hxxps[:]//transfer[.]sh; theft of badges, phone numbers, email addresses, and more from Discord as well as from popular gaming platforms such as Minecraft and Roblox; and screenshot-capture to track real-time user activity.Crypto Heist and Evasive TacticsThe cryptocurrency element was also a hallmark of the first phase of the attacks. Malware spread through the packages would track the user\'s clipboard, scanning for cryptocurrency addresses so they could be replaced with the attacker\'s own."Similar crypto addresses were found across the myriad of malicious packages hinting at a centralized strategy, channeling the redirected funds into a few primary collection points," Gelb noted.The packages didn\'t stop there, but also would tamper with applications such as Exodus — a crypto wallet management app — to alter its core files to enable "unrestricted data exfiltration," he wrote.After the first wave of packages, the attacker added encryption to the plaintext of the malware released in the summer months, making its malicious functionality harder to detect, though at its core the behavior stayed the same.The most recent packages took these deceptive practices even further, including dozens of layers of obfuscation that would hide secondary payloads fetched from an external source in the code.Further, additional payloads included in the latest packages significantly extended the data collection and exfiltration capabilities of earlier packages, as well as included further evasion tactics that could prevent users from downloading antivirus software or checking files for viruses.Attackers also added the ability to steal data from Telegram and pilfer data such as cryptocurrency wallets, system information, antivirus info, task list, Wi-Fi passwords, clipboard data, and specific files from directories like Desktop, Pictures, Documents, Music, Videos, and Downloads directly from the targeted machine, according to the researchers.Beware Suspicious PackagesThreat actors increasingly are recognizing the value of weaponizing open source packages as a way to target the software supply chain and thus reach an enormous target base with significantly less effort than other types of attacks can require.Python, given its widespread use in software development, is an especially popular target for attackers, who have even gone so far as to poison entire projects based in the programming language.Indeed, malware distribution through open source packages is an ongoing threat, one that requires organizations to maintain "constant vigilance and adaptability to effectively protect against it," Gelb wrote.The discovery of the recent Python campaign, in which the attacker constantly evolved to evade detection, highlights how important it is both for security professionals to share open source threat intelligence, and for developers to carefully vet any packages they download, particularly when they come from untrusted sources.</body></div>',

The bugs show that AI applications are equally as susceptible to open source bugs as any other application, researchers noted. The bugs affect Amazon and Google\'s machine learning services, among many others.TorchServe is an open source framework maintained by Amazon and Meta, used for deploying deep-learning models based on the PyTorch open source machine learning library into production environments. It\'s used by many large companies; commercial users of TorchServe include Walmart, Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others.Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could let threat actors access proprietary data in AI models, to insert malicious models into production environments, alter a machine learning model\'s results, and take complete control over servers.Thousands of Targets: Bugs See Wide ExposureThousands of vulnerable instances of the software are publicly exposed on the Internet and open to unauthorized access and a range of other malicious actions, according to researchers at Oligo who discovered the vulnerabilities."TorchServe is among the most popular model-serving frameworks for PyTorch," Oligo researchers Idan Levcovich, Guy Kaplan, and Gal Elbaz wrote in a blog post this week. "Using a simple IP scanner, we were able to find tens of thousands of IP addresses that are currently completely exposed to the attack — including many belonging to Fortune 500 organizations."All versions of TorchServe from 0.8.1 and earlier are vulnerable. Oligo reported the vulnerabilities to PyTorch, which addressed the flaws in TorchServe version 0.8.2. "The update from Oct. 3 dramatically reduced the exposure, and therefore we recommend all users upgrade to the latest version," says Elbaz, co-founder and CTO at Oligo.The ShellTorch FlawsOligo has collectively dubbed the vulnerabilities as "ShellTorch." Two of them are rated as critical with a near-maximum severity rating on the CVSS scale: CVE-2023-43654, a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that enables remote code execution (RCE); and CVE-2022-1471, a Java deserialization RCE.The third ShellTorch vulnerability stems from how TorchServe by default exposes a critical management API to the Internet. Though changing the configuration from default mitigates the issue, many organizations and projects based on TorchServe have used the default configuration."As a result, the vulnerability is also present in Amazon’s and Google’s proprietary Docker images by default, and are present in self-managed services of the largest providers of machine learning services," according to Oligo. "This includes self-managed Amazon AWS SageMaker, self-managed Google Vertex AT, and several other projects built on TorchServe. The misconfiguration is particularly problematic because accessing the management interface requires no authentication at all, so anyone can access it.""Correctly configuring the management interface does close the major attack vector, but ShellTorch can be exploited via additional vectors," Elbaz says.Server-Side Request Forgery FlawOne of these vectors has to do with CVE-2023-43564, the SSRF flaw that the company discovered. The flaw is tied to a TorchServe API for fetching a machine learning model\'s configuration files. Oligo found that while the API contained logic for fetching configuration files from only an allowed list of URLs, by default it accepted any and all domains as valid URLs. An attacker could use the flaw to upload a malicious model into a production environment resulting in arbitrary code execution. When combined with the default configuration error, CVE-2023-43564 allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code in PyTorch environments, Oligo found.CVE-2022-1471 is am RCE vulnerability in SnakeYaml, a widely used open source library that TorchServe implements. Oligo researchers found that by uploading an ML model with a malicious YAML file, they could trigger an attack that resulted in RCE on the underlying server.The vulnerabilities show that AI applications are exposed to the same risks that all applications are exposed to from open source code, Elbaz says. But with AI, the consequences are even greater given the myriad use cases for large language models and other AI technologies. Vulnerabilities such as ShellTorch give attackers a way to corrupt AI models in order to generate misleading answers and create other havoc. "AI is a giant step forward for technology, and with these benefits come new risks — huge potential with huge risks," Elbaz says. "There are new types of risks that we have never really seen before, so we need to be ready to evolve in order to protect AI infrastructure."</body></div>',

In 2021, US schools and colleges spent $3.1bn on these products and this number is expected to grow by 8% every year, according to the report.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><figure id="38eadd3d-6ed8-4897-9bba-2f4d07571bc6"></figure><p>But the ACLU&#8217;s report concludes that there is little to no independent research or evidence that supports that this technology works. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance">Surveillance</a> tech companies say their technology can and has been effective at preventing conflict, violence abuse and self-harm.</p><p>Gaggle, for example, a company that provides surveillance technology and software for kindergarten through 12-grade schools, claims their products are effective at &#8220;preventing suicides&#8221;, &#8220;preventing school violence&#8221; and &#8220;limiting bullying and harassing&#8221;.</p><p>Chad Marlow, a senior policy counsel for the ACLU&#8217;s national office and the report&#8217;s lead author, said that from a research standpoint, these claims are impossible to prove and are misleading to school officials and administrators. The report&#8217;s extensive review of tech companies&#8217; websites and marketing materials showed that companies rarely provide any data to support claims around efficacy.</p><p>Outside of schools, <a href="https://popcenter.asu.edu/sites/default/files/215_greenberg_roush_cctveffectiveness.pdf">research</a> has <a href="https://www.mtas.tennessee.edu/knowledgebase/there-empirical-evidence-surveillance-cameras-reduce-crime">shown</a> that camera surveillance is largely ineffective as a crime deterrent. In the last two decades, eight out of the ten most deadly school shootings took place in schools with surveillance video cameras, according to the report.</p><p>Although school shootings and suicides are rare events, they are every parent&#8217;s worst nightmare and the fear is very real, Marlow said. That makes these products easy to sell and market to schools, according to Marlow.</p><p>&#8220;They [consumers] want the products to work,&#8221; Marlow said. &#8220;You&#8217;re kind of selling people on their hopes and fears rather than reality.&#8221;</p><p>A second key finding in the ACLU&#8217;s report is that school surveillance has a clear negative effect on student&#8217;s mental health and can be especially harmful for historically marginalized and under-resourced students.</p><p>The ACLU commissioned YouGov to complete a national survey on student&#8217;s perceptions towards surveillance tech in their schools. More than 500 students ages 14-18 were asked about their experience in school regarding this technology and almost one-third of students reported this technology makes them feel like they are always being watched.</p><p>When it comes to education technology surveillance in their schools, students reported heightened anxiety, unease and fear. Students also reported a degraded level of trust towards their teachers and school administrators. An analysis of plots against schools conducted by the United States Secret Service showed that students themselves often play an important role in reporting dangerous or self-harm behavior and plots to staff.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to make it less likely that students are going to reach out for help,&#8221; said Amelia Vance, the president of the Public Interest Privacy Center. This constant monitoring has a demonstrated chilling effect on students and makes it less likely that they will seek the sometimes life saving help they and other students need, Vance said.</p><p>The ACLU report also offers recommendations to school districts and state level decision-makers about which tools are proven to work. These tools include mental health counselors, guidance counselors, hall monitors, doors that lock from the inside and other proven techniques that benefit student safety.</p><p>&#8220;I think the problem is much of what we&#8217;re doing when it comes to student surveillance technology only makes us<em> feel</em> safer,&#8221; Marlow said. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t actually make the kids any safer &#8230; and it&#8217;s hurting our kids in the process.&#8221;</p></div></div></div></body></html>',

While stolen data is an obvious impact of a breach, lost profits and corporate reputation can also cause significant and even longer-lasting damage to businesses. The consequences are often felt long after the initial breach as they can erode customers' trust, lead to declining stock prices for public companies, and force businesses to raise prices to deal with lost profits.That's all to say, a data breach can have a massive impact on all areas of the business… but what if that was no longer the case?Imagine a future where a breach is harmless — it's not that they won't happen, but they won't matter. A company is infiltrated, attackers make their way into the network and maybe even access an employee's device, but the data remains safe and uncompromised. And because there is no data loss, the reputational fallout is next to nothing, as organizations can confidently say that corporate and customer data was protected despite the breach.Sounds great, right? It's entirely possible — but only if organizations commit to a needed, if not overdue, paradigm shift in their security strategies.A Paradigm Shift in SecurityFor years, the dominant theory was to build security around the network: protect the perimeter and keep bad actors out. This approach ended up being insufficient as bigger and higher walls don't matter when the perimeter is porous. Next, the growth of endpoints and more distributed workforces created a new strategy where security was built around devices. This approach again fell short as device-based security leaves gaps when it comes to third parties with access to enterprise assets.Building security around networks and devices alone isn't effective. It's time to shift the focus to building security around the data itself. This model embeds granular security controls not around devices or workers but around the digital assets to ensure they're used only as intended. These controls travel wherever the data goes whether inside or outside the enterprise, are agnostic to the mediums through which data is shared and stored, and allow access to digital assets to be updated any time.By securing data outside the network perimeter, organizations can retain visibility and control of their sensitive assets, even while sharing critical information with third-party collaborators. This enables them to secure their supply chain without slowing growth for the enterprise. By focusing on protecting data rather than networks or endpoints, organizations not only protect their most critical and sensitive assets but also proactively mitigate the impact of any future breach.5 Steps to Reduce the Impact of BreachesHere are five steps security professionals can take to reorient their cybersecurity strategy and reduce the impact of breaches:Communicate to executive leaders why this shift is necessary: Firewalls and endpoint protection have dominated security for years, so there's an element of change management needed. Before transitioning to a data-oriented model, you need to gain buy-in from the executive team. When preparing for this discussion, pull from recent well-known breaches like Log4j and MOVEit to highlight lost profits and reputational fallout. During the conversation, lean into other benefits this shift will usher in, such as greater compliance. Higher-level business values can resonate better with non-technical stakeholders than pure cybersecurity use cases.Know and classify your data: After getting buy-in from executives, identify the most valuable data and classify it accordingly. To classify your data, ask questions such as: What is the purpose of the data? What format is the data in? Where does the data live? Who uses it, and are they in or outside the organization?Develop policies that continuously protect data: When deciding the best policies for the enterprise, you must understand the data's lifecycle (such as who uses it when, how they use it) and address the different levels of risk different groups of data might require. As you create policies, be sure to include real users of the data to create the most usable processes.Automate your data protection: Automation is a necessary element in data security as it helps avoid human error or oversights. Teams should consider practices like automatically classifying data from certain users or teams or whenever certain information is mentioned (for example, financial statements).Solicit feedback and prioritize usability: Rigid security policies can prevent work from being completed, leading to frustrated employees looking for ways to get around security measures. Include employees outside the security team to see what is working and what isn't, where they may need more flexibility, and when workflow processes may be changing.A single data breach can turn a company upside down, at times beyond recovery. But in the years to come, it doesn't have to be that way. By evolving past outdated cybersecurity paradigms that no longer serve modern enterprises, organizations can not only develop stronger security practices but render breaches inconsequential.</body></div>",

Some of the most visible cyberattacks in recent months have reminded us that we all play a role in security and people remain our weakest link. Threat actors continue to take advantage of human nature by using phishing emails, persuasive text messages and convincing phone calls to gain access to high value systems and sensitive data and reap financial rewards. Given the headlines, it makes sense this month to take a closer look at the people problem and what organizations can do to strengthen defenses.</p>\n<p>The people problem is two-fold: a lack of security awareness among users and a lack of cybersecurity talent. Let&#8217;s start with the first challenge, what organizations can do to raise security awareness among users.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Support for security awareness programs:</strong> According to the SANS 2023 Security Awareness Report: Managing Human Risk (<a href="https://go.sans.org/wp_2023_security_awareness_report.pdf">PDF</a>), maturity levels for security awareness programs are improving when compared to last year. However, organizations are struggling with the fundamentals of program development including lack of budget, limits on training time for employees, and lack of staffing and time for program management. It comes as no surprise that the most effective programs are backed by strong leadership support, have dedicated full-time employees, and promote a strong security culture where incident reporting is encouraged and made easy which helps mitigate risk.</li>\n<li><strong>User training:</strong> Also not surprising, the SANS report finds that phishing/smishing/vishing tops the list of human risks, followed by passwords/authentication, detection/reporting, and IT admin misconfiguration. Training should focus on these four areas and go beyond annual computer-based training to include continuous training so that key concepts are reinforced year-round. Involving security teams in the development of human-focused security training helps ensure content remains highly relevant to the organization. Partnering with other departments such as communications and human resources and bringing on third-party training consultants will also help drive program effectiveness while optimizing resources.</li>\n</ul><p>Looking at the second component of the people problem &#8211; a lack of cybersecurity talent &#8211; a combination of training and technology can help close the gap currently estimated at <a href="https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">663,600</a> in the U.S. alone. For example:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Cybersecurity professionals training:</strong> Cybersecurity itself is a continuous learning experience, something that is often overlooked. New research by Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) finds that 40% of cybersecurity professionals believe their organization should increase its commitment to cybersecurity training to help address the skills shortage by enabling the organization to get more out of existing resources. Partnering with security technology vendors that offer product training and make it available in multiple formats and form factors, including instructor-led/in-person, instructor-led/virtual, and self-service, provides flexibility to select what works best for your business model and your security teams.</li>\n<li><strong>Security automation:</strong> An important benefit of security automation is that the highly skilled human resources you have can work smarter, not harder. In research we commissioned recently, security leaders say the number one way to address a top challenge &#8211; high turnover rates &#8211; is with smarter tools that simplify work. Additionally, over 60% expect automation to positively affect employee satisfaction and retention. A balanced approach to automation where repetitive, low-risk, time-consuming tasks are automated so that analysts are freed-up to take the lead on irregular, high-impact, time-sensitive work can improve retention and utilization while driving better security outcomes. And a data-driven approach to automation ensures that actions remain relevant for greater focus, accuracy and confidence in the outcomes. Additionally, security automation platforms that support low-code/no-code interfaces can make automation accessible to a range of users with varying skill sets.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional, new technologies</strong>: Approaches and technologies like AI are already helping to drive efficiencies. Specifically, natural language processing is being used to identify and extract threat data, such as indicators of compromise, malware and adversaries, from unstructured text in data feed sources and intelligence reports so that analysts spend less time on manual tasks and more time proactively addressing risks. Machine learning (ML) techniques are being applied to make sense of all this data in order to get the right data to the right systems and teams at the right time to accelerate detection, investigation and response. And a closed loop model with feedback, ensures AI capable security operations platforms can continue to learn and improve over time.</li>\n</ul><p>Threat actors continue to use variations of the same threat vectors year after year to execute successful attacks. Fortunately, we have it in our power to disrupt the cycle. Addressing the people problem with effective approaches and tools for users and security practitioners to strengthen defenses will enable us to work smarter, and force attackers into a position where <strong><em>they</em></strong> must work harder.</p>\n<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><p></p>\n</div></div></div></body></html>',

This suggests, according to Talos, that the law enforcement operation impacted only Qakbot command and control (C&amp;C) servers, without affecting spam delivery infrastructure.&#160;&#160;\n</p><p>The campaign delivering Ransom Knight and Remcos malware appears to be the work of Qakbot affiliates known for a previous operation named &#8216;AA&#8217;, which ran in 2021 and 2022.&#160;\n</p><p>&#8220;We assess Qakbot will likely continue to pose a significant threat moving forward.

The RAT can exfiltrate information from the infected system, can disable security programs, kill processes, prevent the use of mouse and keyboard, and even shut down the system.\n</p><p>ReversingLabs&#8217; analysis of the malware variant used in this attack also revealed the inclusion of support for a new command that allowed the threat actor to launch an older version of the r77 rootkit on the victim&#8217;s system.\n</p><p>An open source malware, r77 is easy to deploy, can be bundled with other software, and can hide its presence on the system, via two registry subkeys (one for the executable path and another for the malware&#8217;s process).</p><div><span>Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.</span></div>\n<p>According to ReversingLabs, all ten versions of the malicious package downloaded the same executable delivering DiscordRAT 2.0, which in turn could execute the r77 rootkit. The RAT also included a command to remove the rootkit.\n</p><p>The most recent two versions of the malicious package also contained code to fetch a PyInstaller-compiled executable serving the Blank-Grabber information stealer.\n</p><p>The malicious &#8216;node-hide-console-windows&#8217; package has been removed from the NPM repository.\n</p><p><strong>The threat to open source developers</strong>\n</p><p>Despite the threat actor&#8217;s efforts to make the malicious package seem trustworthy, the campaign does not show signs of sophistication, especially given the use of open source malware that could be easily detected, but the threat it poses should not be underestimated.\n</p><p>&#8220;Regardless of how this campaign ranks in sophistication, these packages highlight an always present, and growing, danger lurking on public repositories such as NPM or PyPI, as well as on GitHub. Something as dangerous and invasive as a rootkit is easily available to everyone, well documented, and ready for use,&#8221; ReversingLabs notes.\n</p><p>According to Bugcrowd director of cybersecurity Sajeeb Lohani, this attack underlines the risks developers expose themselves to when placing trust in open source packages without thoroughly verifying them first.\n</p><p>&#8220;Installing any software package from a majority of the package managers, basically runs the code written by the author. This puts a large amount of trust on package developers, which can be abused, allowing the threat actor to compromise any system that downloads and installs the package,&#8221; Lohani said in an emailed comment.\n</p><p>Keeper Security head of product Zane Bond, points out that this campaign shows once again the increasing interest of threat actors in open source environments, which allows them to set up impactful supply chain attacks.\n</p><p>&#8220;Open-source packages are the underpinnings of many enterprise software systems that are distributed globally, and is one reason supply chain security has become a priority in recent years. Cybersecurity technologies protecting these environments must cover every user, on every device, from every location,&#8221; Bond said.\n</p><p>Developers who downloaded the malicious package and were infected with the r77 rootkit, Lohani says, should re-install their systems, to remove any malware.\n</p><p>&#8220;Since r77 is a fileless rootkit, and the framework may have been modified prior to deployment, it is often safer to re-image the affected device, following disaster recovery protocols. I strongly recommend having proper logs sent to immutable log storage services, which helps a blue team to search and identify potentially affected systems,&#8221; Lohani said.\n</p><p>Additionally, Netenrich principal threat hunter John Bambenek underlines, it is critically important to maintain visibility into all dependencies used within a development environment, to remedy any attack efficiently.\n</p><p>&#8220;Teams need to keep a strong and accurate library of what packages are installed so they can quickly go back and remove libraries that have been compromised or malicious typosquatted libraries, as that is a manual process,&#8221; Bambenek commented.\n</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href="https://www.securityweek.com/dozens-of-malicious-npm-packages-steal-user-system-data/"><strong> </strong>Dozens of Malicious NPM Packages Steal User, System Data</a>\n</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href="https://www.securityweek.com/developers-warned-of-malicious-pypi-npm-ruby-packages-targeting-macs/"> Developers Warned of Malicious PyPI, NPM, Ruby Packages Targeting Macs</a>\n</p><p><strong>Related:</strong><a href="https://www.securityweek.com/malicious-nuget-packages-used-to-target-net-developers/"> Malicious NuGet Packages Used to Target .NET Developers</a>\n</p><p>\n</p></div></div></div></body></html>',

All of these insurance companies were victims of the MOVEit file transfer cyberattack.Aside from MOVEit, other common ransomware attacks also targeted the insurance industry. Point32Health, the parent company of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Tufts Health Plan, was hit by a ransomware attack in April, while NationsBenefits reported that it was a victim of the Cl0p ransomware gang. The largest US attack on an insurance company compromised 9 million patients of Managed Care of North America (MCNA) Dental, a victim of the LockBit attack.Consulting firm Deloitte noted, "Cyber-attacks in the insurance sector are growing exponentially as insurance companies migrate toward digital channels in an effort to create tighter customer relationships, offer new products and expand their share of customers\' financial portfolios. This shift is driving increased investment in traditional core IT systems (e.g., policy and claims systems) as well as in highly integrated enabling platforms such as agency portals, online policy applications and web- and mobile-based apps for filing claims."The firm added, "As insurers find new and innovative ways to analyze data, they must also find ways to secure the data from cyber-attacks."Applications Reveal a LotThe reasons insurance brokers and carriers are now in the hotseat are varied, as Deloitte noted, but several stand out as key motives. While the most mundane is the profitability of obtaining personally identifiable information and personal health information for resale, there are more nefarious inducements to attack insurers. For example, insurance applications.The amount of private, corporate data that appears on an insurance application could be a bonanza to cyber attackers, says Marc Schein, national co-chair of the Cyber Risk Practice and a risk management consultant at Marsh McLennan Agency, an insurance broker. Schein notes that applications include a vast array of potentially useful information, including the amount of insurance a company is purchasing (ransomware attackers do not want to leave money on the table when they demand a ransom) as well as some of the deficiencies a company might have in its network security.Schein points out that other insurance products, such as errors and omissions policies or directors and officers policies, could provide valuable information about trade secrets, private information of key company executives, and data about potential business transactions.Patricia Titus is chief privacy and information security officer at Markel Insurance, a carrier that underwrites its own assurance, specialty, and international policies. She agrees that applications can provide a deep understanding of a company\'s technology profile.Insurance applications can identify technology debt, Titus says — unpatched software, outdated hardware that might be past the manufacturer\'s security or software patches, legacy systems that could represent potential security vulnerabilities, and other deficiencies a company might have in its network security. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers.All Sides of Insurance Transactions Are VulnerableIt is not only insurance clients that need to evaluate their cybersecurity infrastructure, Titus points out. Markel is looking at ways it can better protect its own data, as well as that of its clients.In Markel\'s case, Titus says, the company is looking at technologies that could do a better job of microsegmenting its networks, limiting the ability of attackers to move laterally through the network should they successfully breach the corporate defenses. Moving laterally, she notes, is the greatest advantage an attack can have if they can find a hole into a network.Human data always is interesting to cyber attackers, Titus adds. Should the attacker be able to access insurance applications or approved policies, they can learn a great deal about potential targets. Individuals and companies alike need to insure high-value luxury items, such as antiques. However, enterprises also insure trade secrets (think of the recipe of Coca-Cola, for example) that cannot be made public through patents, private data about executives and officers, and errors and omissions that might occur during business transactions. Ultimately, there is a vast array of data companies protect that can be identified and compromised should their insurance policies or applications be breached.Schein recommends that companies submitting an insurance application send encrypted files only so that anything intercepted during transmission cannot be read by the attacker.</body></div>',

		"family of malware. The 404 Keylogger, also known as Snake Keylogger, is a modular .NET keylogger and infostealer that was first spotted in late November 2020. It is primarily designed to record users' keystrokes and transmit collected data to threat actors. The malware is typically delivered to target systems via malicious email attachments, infected software downloads, or drive-by downloads. Once installed on a system, the malware operates in the background and collects information as the user interacts with their computer, including taking screenshots and extracting data from the clipboard. The Snake Keylogger is also capable of stealing sensitive information such as logins, passwords, and credentials, and has been observed in ongoing email campaigns aimed at mass distribution of the malware. Additionally, the Snake Keylogger has been found to share code similarities with other .NET keyloggers, suggesting a potential link between different malware families.",
